# Logo Setup Instructions 🎨

## Step 1: Copy Logo to Public Folder
Copy the uploaded logo file (`3.png`) to your project's `public` folder and rename it to `logo.png`:

```bash
# In your project root:
cp /path/to/3.png public/logo.png
```

Or manually:
1. Copy `3.png` file
2. Paste into `ddd-dash/public/` folder  
3. Rename to `logo.png`

## Step 2: Verify
The logo should now appear on the welcome screen with:
- ✅ Transparent background
- ✅ Yellow glow effect
- ✅ Centered and responsive
- ✅ Max width for mobile

## Logo Placement:
- **Location:** Top of welcome screen
- **Position:** Above "Race Against Time!" tagline
- **Style:** Drop shadow glow effect

That's it! The logo will automatically load when you run the app. 🚀
